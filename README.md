## Why SeeseoCrawler?

At [SEObserver](https://www.seobserver.com), we crawl billions of pages. We built SeeseoCrawler because every SEO deserves a proper crawler — one that stores data in a columnar database and lets you query millions of pages in milliseconds, even while the crawl is ongoing.

**We're giving it to the community for free.** Use it, break it, improve it.

### What it does

- Crawls websites following internal links from seed URLs
- Extracts **45+ SEO signals** per page (title, canonical, meta tags, headings, hreflang, Open Graph, schema.org, images, links, indexability...)
- Respects `robots.txt` and per-host crawl delays
- Tracks redirect chains, response times, and body sizes
- Stores everything in a columnar database for instant analytical queries
- Computes **PageRank** and **crawl depth** per session
- Comes with a **web UI**, a **REST API**, and a **native desktop app**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL crawlobserver.com/install.sh | sh
./crawlobserver
```

That's it. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8899` — the setup wizard guides you through the rest. SeeseoCrawler downloads and manages its own database on first run.

> **macOS desktop app:** download the DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/SEObserver/crawlobserver/releases/latest).

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

ClickHouse does not provide a native Windows binary, so SeeseoCrawler needs Docker to run the database:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) (free)
2. Download `crawlobserver-windows-amd64.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/SEObserver/crawlobserver/releases/latest)
3. Open a terminal in the download folder and run:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
.\crawlobserver-windows-amd64.exe serve
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Requires Go 1.25+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SEObserver/crawlobserver.git
cd crawlobserver
make build
./crawlobserver
```

</details>

> **Advanced:** You can also point SeeseoCrawler at an existing database instance (Docker, remote server...). See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for `clickhouse.*` settings.

---

## Web UI

Start the web interface with `./crawlobserver serve` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8899`.

The UI gives you:

- **Session management** &mdash; start, stop, resume, delete crawl sessions
- **Page explorer** &mdash; filter and browse crawled pages by status code, title, depth, word count...
- **Tabs** &mdash; overview, titles, meta, headings, images, indexability, response codes, internal links, external links
- **PageRank** &mdash; distribution histogram, treemap by path, top-N pages
- **robots.txt tester** &mdash; view robots.txt per host and test URL access
- **Sitemap viewer** &mdash; discover and browse sitemap trees
- **Real-time progress** &mdash; live crawl stats via Server-Sent Events
- **Theming** &mdash; custom accent color, logo, dark mode
- **API key management** &mdash; project-scoped keys for programmatic access

The UI is a single Go binary — no Node.js runtime needed in production.

<summary><strong>Why a columnar database?</strong></summary>

A crawl is a link graph, so why not a graph database? Because **a crawler is an analytics pipeline, not a graph explorer.** The questions you ask are analytical — "show me all pages with a missing H1 and a 301 canonical", "give me PageRank percentiles by subdirectory" — and columnar databases answer these instantly, even over millions of rows.

When we need graph algorithms (PageRank, crawl depth), we compute them in-memory in Go and write the results back. A million-page link graph fits in ~200MB of RAM and computes in seconds — no need for a graph database.

Under the hood, SeeseoCrawler uses ClickHouse in managed mode: it downloads a static binary and runs it as a subprocess. You see one program; it gets concurrent read/write access, columnar compression (~10:1), and instant session deletion.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How internal PageRank works</strong></summary>

SeeseoCrawler computes PageRank in-memory using the iterative power method (damping factor 0.85, up to 20 iterations, 1e-6 convergence threshold). The result is normalized to a 0&ndash;100 logarithmic scale.

**Key modeling choices:**

1. **External links dilute PR.** When a page has outgoing links to external sites, those links are counted in the total outlink divisor. A page with 3 internal links and 7 external links passes `PR/10` to each internal target &mdash; not `PR/3`. This correctly models the fact that link equity is split across *all* outgoing links, not just internal ones.

2. **Nofollow / sponsored / UGC links dilute but do not pass PR.** Links with `rel="nofollow"`, `rel="sponsored"`, or `rel="ugc"` are counted in the total outlink divisor (they consume link equity) but are excluded from the edge graph (they don't transfer it). This matches the "evaporating" model: nofollow links burn PageRank without redirecting it.

3. **External-only pages are not dangling.** A page that links only to external sites is *not* treated as a dangling node. Its rank leaks out of the internal graph instead of being redistributed. Only pages with zero outgoing links (true dead ends) trigger dangling-node redistribution.

4. **Self-links are excluded.** A page linking to itself does not count as an outgoing link for PageRank purposes.

5. **Redirect/canonical consolidation.** Pages that redirect (3xx) or have a non-self canonical are consolidated into their final target in the link graph. Links pointing to `/old` (which 301s to `/new`) are treated as links to `/new`. Redirect chains incur a 10% PR loss per hop (retention factor 0.90), while canonical consolidation transfers PR without penalty.

6. **Logarithmic scale.** The final 0&ndash;100 normalization uses `log1p(linear) / log1p(100) * 100` instead of a linear scale. This spreads the distribution so that smaller pages are more differentiated (a page at 10% of the max scores ~52 instead of 10, a page at 1% scores ~15 instead of 1). The maximum remains 100.

These choices mean that SeeseoCrawler's internal PageRank is conservative: pages that link heavily to external sites or use nofollow on internal links will show lower PR flow than a naive internal-only model would suggest. We believe this better reflects how search engines handle link equity.
